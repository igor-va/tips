# Terminology
Docker Image  # The docker image is a file or executable package comprised of everything needed to run
                an application, including code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files
Docker Containers  # The actual runtime instance of docker images
                    They are isolated environments that can run an application and its dependencies without 
                    interfering with the host system or other containers running on the same system
Docker Hub  # The cloud-based repository service where Docker images can be stored, managed, and shared with others
Dockerfile  # The file without any extension that contains instructions for building a Docker image
Build  # Build refers to the process of creating a Docker image from a Dockerfile

# Commands
docker pull <image_name>  # This command downloads the specified Docker image from a Docker registry 
                            (such as Docker Hub) and stores it on your local system
docker build -t <image_name> .  # This command builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile located in the current
                                    directory and tags it with the specified name
docker run <image_name>  # This command runs a Docker container from the specified image
    -d  # Run the container in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background and does not attach to the console
    -p 4444:4444  # “-p 4444:4444” maps the container’s port 4444 to the host machine’s port 4444
    -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm  # Mounts the shared memory directory on the host machine to the same directory inside the container, 
                            which is required for Chrome to function properly in a containerized environment
docker ps  # This command lists all running Docker containers
    -a  # List all the containers including the ones that are stopped
docker stop <container_id>  # This command stops a running Docker container
docker rm <container_id>  # This command removes a stopped Docker container
docker images  # This command lists all Docker images that are currently available on your system
docker push <image_name>  # This command uploads a Docker image to a Docker registry
docker start <container_id>  #
docker pause <container_id>  #
docker unpause <container_id>  #
docker kill <container_id>  #

# Volume - a persistent data storage mechanism that allows a container to store and access data outside of its filesystem
docker volume create
docker volume ls
docker volume rm
docker volume inspect

# Compose - is a tool that allows defining and running multi-container applications
docker compose build  # Build project
docker compose up  # This command starts the containers defined in the docker-compose.yaml file
    --scale chrome=3  # The nodes can be scaled up
    -d  # Detached mode
docker compose down  # Bring the container down
